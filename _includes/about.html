				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Greetings! I am a web developer with 3 years full time experience. I've got a passion for front end web development, and the back end know-how to support that. I love to use cutting edge technology and the latest web standards to craft lean, mean and clean code that runs like greased lightning. I like to work alongside designers to see their vision come to life and pull off pixel perfection. I'm as comfortable mentoring others, as I am learning from them.</p>
